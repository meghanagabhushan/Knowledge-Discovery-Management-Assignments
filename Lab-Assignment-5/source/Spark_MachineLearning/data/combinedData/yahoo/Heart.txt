could i die with this bicuspid aortic valve disease i asked earlier what it was now i know what it is is it possible to die or have any complications what so ever with it and only the problem with bicuspid valves is that they have a tendency to become calcified and fibrotic hard and thickened over time if you are not seen regularly by a cardiologist and the valve becomes very calcified it can make it difficult for your heart to get enough blood flow out to your body think of a showerhead with the nozzles clogged leading to symptoms of chest pain fainting spells or heart failure on the flipside some people with bicuspid aortic valves will have more trouble with valve leakiness than with a tight valve a leaky valve makes your heart work extra hard to get the same amount of blood out to your body as a heart without any leaky valves over time this can overwork your heart and make it start to fail third a few people with bicuspid aortic valves have abnormalities with their aortas as well and can develop aneurysms or narrowings that need to be addressed now i will say this don't panic bicuspid aortic valves are actually quite common and people who live with them usually live normal lifespans the above complications tend to be seen in people who do not get regular follow up and let things progress until they are really bad before they go to their doctor unfortunately the fact is that most patients with bicuspid aortic valves will require surgery during their lifetime for some with more deformed valves intervention is required in childhood or adulthood however the majority have relatively normal valve function and remain undiagnosed until late in adulthood when the valve becomes stiff it is impossible to predict when you will need surgery to replace your valve but the most important thing is to follow up with your cardiologist on a regular basis you need to know that a cardiologist will need to monitor you with echocardiograms to help determine if and when you need to have anything done don't worry though as long as you keep seeing a cardiologist who understands bicuspid aortic disease you should be ok surgery is very safe these days and you can generally expect a long and healthy life even after having your valve replaced hope that helps good luck

can you have a stroke and not know it my gramps fell twice and is now in the hospital the dr s said he had a stoke but me and my family did not notice anything about it at home we all live together he's been in there for almost weeks so is it possible to have a stroke and not know it yes it is possible if the stroke was small let me clarify some of the answers a transient ischemic attack or tia and a reversible ischemic neurologic deficit or rind are not strokes they produce stroke like symptoms but not actual damage they do increase the likelihood of future strokes tias and rinds are similar to a person who has chest pain but does not have a heart attack it is unusual for a person to be in a hospital for weeks due to a stroke so i assume there must be more to the story early and aggressive rehabilitation is critical for stroke victims i am truly sorry to hear about your grandfather and wish him a full and speedy recovery and god's blessing to your family

if you have low blood pressure can you still play sports all the time and stuff sevynn marie to be honest most people who have been told that they have a low blood pressure actually have a blood pressure that is normal for them one thing to remember is that blood pressures increase as people get older in healthy young individuals it is not uncommon to see systolic blood pressures that's the top number less than sometimes even into the s i've seen healthy young women with perfectly good blood pressures of say that worry about their low blood pressure if you feel fine and don't suffer from light headedness or excessive fatigue then your blood pressure is most likely adequate for you there are people who run low blood pressures and complain of fainting or lightheadedness when they stand in these cases there is potential benefit in giving meds to increase the blood pressure so the first question is do you really have low blood pressure or do you have blood pressure that might be low for a year old man but is perfectly fine for you if you are not suffering from fainting lightheadedness or excess fatigue then there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to play sports based on your blood pressure in fact blood pressure normally increases during exercise it will not however increase your blood pressure over the long term as the other answerer suggests hope that helps feel free to message me with more info if you like good luck to you

i would like a list of all fatty foods what are they i have fatty liver if you would like to educate yourself not only about foods that are high in fat but which are the good fats and which are the bad fats i would check out the american heart association's website http www americanheart org presenter jhtml identifier while it is a good idea for everybody to make improvements in their diet however i have to agree with 'pharma' that fatty liver is not directly related to how much fatty food you eat at the same time excessive alcohol is only one of many causes of a fatty liver to assume that alcohol is the reason for your condition would be a mistake two very common reasons for non alcoholic fatty liver disease or nafld in the united states are diabetes and obesity however it can also be caused by a variety of medications this is something you should explore with your doctor only with a complete history and physical exam can a physician best advise you on how to manage the problem for now general measures such as avoiding alcohol losing weight and making sure that your blood pressure and cholesterol are well managed should do it while fatty foods don't directly cause a fatty liver improving you diet will certainly improve some of the risk factors that are more directly related to the fatty liver talk to your doctor and see if any of your meds could be responsible see if he thinks you should be screened for diabetes hope you find that helpful good luck to you

what does this mean in dumb terms basically i have a heart condition and im and the doctor told me i have bicuspid aortic valve disease and when i asked him what is that he ignored me ive tried looking on the internet and found only smart things pretty much can anyone explain to me what it is what can happen to me and am i likey to have a heart attack hi and only the first thing you should know is that a bicuspid aortic valve is the most common form of congenital heart defect affecting up to of the population there is also a genetic component of patients with bicuspid aortic valves have other family members with the same thing thus we generally recommend that first degree relatives of people with bicuspid aortic valves get screening echocardiograms normally the aortic valve is made up of three separate leaflets that form what looks like a mercedes benz symbol when they come together in a bicuspid aortic valve there is incomplete separation of two of the three leaflets hence the term bicuspid or two leaflets the problem is that these abnormal valves have a tendency to become calcified and fibrotic hard and thickened over time unfortunately the fact is that most patients with bicuspid aortic valves will require surgery during their lifetime for some with more deformed valves intervention is required in childhood or adulthood however the majority have relatively normal valve function and remain undiagnosed until late in adulthood when the valve becomes stiff it is impossible to predict when you will need surgery to replace your valve but the most important thing is to follow up with your cardiologist on a regular basis you need to know that a cardiologist will need to monitor you with echocardiograms because patients with bicuspid aortic valve are not only at risk for developing a stiff aortic valve but can develop a severely leaky aortic valve an enlarged aorta and even dissection in the worst cases the decision to take you to surgery is not based on symptoms alone although those are definitely important as well your doctor will watch the gradient across the valve the amount of valve leakiness and the size of your aorta if the valve is very leaky and your heart function is starting to suffer surgery is generally recommended if the aortic root is getting bigger to the point where there is a risk of aortic dissection surgery is generally recommended if the gradient becomes severe we consider this to be a mean gradient of mmhg or more and you have symptoms sugery is generally recommended the question of whether to recommend surgery in an asymptomatic patient with severe aortic stenosis is more controversial and should be discussed with your cardiologist don't worry though as long as you keep seeing a cardiologist who understands bicuspid aortic disease you should be ok surgery is very safe these days and you can generally expect a long and healthy life even after having your valve replaced hope that helps good luck

heart flutters i am a very healthy and active almost year old i have also expereinced heart flutters twice i have experienced what i thought was a heart attack i felt extreme shooting pains up my arm my chest felt very heavy and as though i was being pounded by a hammer i have had several tests done all that show no results this was about years ago today i expereinced heart flutters again which i have experienced on and off but they are getting increasingly worse this one lasted about seconds to a minute and left me feeling very light headed tired sore and like i was going to pass out i do not want to cause a commotion with my family oddly enough all of these symptoms have occured at a resting heartrate i was just wondering if anyone could tell me waht could be causing this and if i should have testing done again i had a doctor say she might have heard a heart murmer it was dismissed as being acid reflux but im unsure if this is correct i had a stress test done and they did an ultrasound of my heart i have a month old son who is perfect i dont feel much stress at all my life is very simple it does not occur too often maybe twice a month my chest is still sore from hours ago there are several common reasons to feel palpitations that fluttering feeling they can be caused by stress too much caffeine or even a prolapsed heart valve your symptoms sound like they could be caused by extra electrical pathways in your heart that you were born with most of these are not life threatening but can be very annoying a general term for this is svt or supraventricular tachycardia two of the more common svt's are called av node re entry and wolf parkinson white syndrome find a cardiologist who can help with a more specific diagnosis if needed you can ask about an electrophysiologist a cardiologist who specializes in heart rhythms there are ways to treat these symptoms find more information at the heart rhythm society webpage good luck

do i need to pre medicate for the dentist after a heart attack this is the link to the new guidelines for antiobiotic premedication prior to dental work http www ada org public topics antibiotics asp it is most likely that you will not need premedication prior to your dental visits but when i see a patient with a red flag i call the cardiologist directly and they make the call since they know you and know your history you should ask the cardiologist and have them send or you hand carry a note from them to your dentist with their recommendations i personally want a handwritten and signed note from the cardiologist because of having an issue with the cardiologist's office saying no and then changing their mind to a yes so make sure you are completely clear what they want you to do to protect yourself best jamrdh a dental hygienist
