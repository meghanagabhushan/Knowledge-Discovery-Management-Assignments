how do vitamins work exactly i take seven seas one a day i would be interested to know do these vitamins really work to help your body and if i go to the toilet right away do i lose the vitamins vitamin pills suppliment the vitamins that are naturally found in the food you eat this is useful for instance if you don't like veggies because it gives you vitamins that are found in vegetables but without having to eat the stuff a good vitamin suppliment does work and is recommended to maintain a healthy and balanced diet they take time for your body to metabolize and digest so no you don't lose them if you go to the bathroom right away just like any other food you take in when you take a vitamin it is best to take a multivitamin that has lots of different stuff in it as opposed to a pill that has just one vitamin in it for example multi is better than taking just calcium or just iron etc unless your doctor prescribes it

better to work out everyday or every other is it better to weight lift everyday while concentrating on specific area or every other day while working everything i work out every other day while making sure i hit everything with different variations i figured that your body recoops in hours so why not work everything every other day thinking that you will get better gains looking for opinions facts please it's really up to you i also prefer to work out the total body every other day but some people who are limited with time and need quicker work outs can split it up cardio can be done every day without a doubt muscled definately need time to repair so if you decide to try splitting it up it's a good rule to do upper body one day and then lower the next you could also work back and shoulders one day biceps tri's the next and so on and then just do cardio good luck
